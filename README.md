# What is DALI?
DALI is jointly initiated by Philips, Osram, Tridonic, Siemens and other companies in 1999.It ensures that DALI device from different manufacturers can be fully compatible. This technology is as an open industry standard,and it has been incorporated ECG international standards IEC929 and IEC62386-102-2009.

DALI Digital Addressable Lighting Interface is a data transfer protocol. A DALI network consists of a controller and one or more lighting devices (e.g., electrical ballasts and dimmers) that have DALI interfaces. The controller can monitor and control each light by means of a bi-directional data exchange. The DALI protocol permits devices to be individually addressed and it also incorporates Group and Scene broadcast messages to simultaneously address multiple devices.Each lighting device is assigned a unique static address in the numeric range 0 to 63, making possible up to 64 devices in a standalone system. Alternatively, DALI can be used as a subsystem via DALI gateways to address more than 64 devices
